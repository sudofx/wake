"""
WAKE DURABLE RECORD
=====================

This module owns the authoritative history and the deterministic projection from
that history into current state. SQLite is used as a durable append-only event
container, not as a mutable table of current objects.

Every meaningful proposal produces exactly one event:

    accepted -> receipt + transition + revision advance
    rejected -> receipt + no transition + unchanged revision

Rejected events remain in the chain because they are evidence of what the
system refused. They do not alter state. That distinction makes correction
possible without silently rewriting history.

Events are linked by SHA-256 hashes over canonical JSON and the previous hash.
The chain detects accidental or unauthorized row changes during replay. It is
not a signature and does not prove who authored an event; anyone with write
access to the entire database could rebuild the chain. Its guarantee is local
integrity detection against the expected stored head, not external notarization.

Current state is never trusted as a separate cache. ``replay`` starts from an
empty mapping, verifies every event in sequence, and applies only accepted
operations. If an event hash, revision edge, or operation is invalid, replay
stops rather than returning a plausible partial state.

The record does not decide whether an operation is allowed. Governance owns
permission before append. ``apply_operation`` owns the exact semantics needed
to reconstruct already accepted history. Keeping those responsibilities
separate prevents historical data from becoming valid merely because replay can
mechanically interpret it.
