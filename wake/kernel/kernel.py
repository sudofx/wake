WAKE KERNEL
=============

Kernel coordinates the governed-work loop:

    Record -> Context -> Proposal -> Governance -> Transition -> Receipt

It owns sequencing, not policy and not database mechanics. RecordStore verifies
and replays history. Governance decides whether a proposal is permitted.
Providers only produce proposals. Kernel makes those owners meet inside one
coherent operation without allowing any of them to impersonate another.

The key boundary is deliberate: Kernel knows semantic transactions but knows
nothing about SQLite, SQL, connection objects, commits, or rollbacks. A storage
backend must provide one serialized write transaction spanning authoritative
replay, duplicate detection, governance, and append. This lets the initial
SQLite implementation be replaced without changing kernel behavior.

Rejected proposals follow the same append path as accepted proposals. Their
revision does not advance and replay applies none of their operations, but their
receipt remains durable evidence. Provider exceptions before proposal creation
remain outside this boundary and do not fabricate a proposal receipt.
