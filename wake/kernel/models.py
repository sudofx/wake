WAKE BOUNDARY VALUES
======================

This module defines the small vocabulary allowed to cross the kernel's trust
boundaries. The classes here do not perform work, consult providers, govern
proposals, or mutate the record. They make the shape of those handoffs explicit.

That restraint matters because wake is designed around replaceable
intelligence. A provider can disappear immediately after producing a Proposal.
The durable system must still know exactly what was proposed, which record
revision informed it, and how to describe the resulting receipt without relying
on provider-local memory or Python object identity.

The value objects intentionally remain plain frozen dataclasses:

    Context  -> bounded evidence supplied to an intelligence
    Proposal -> untrusted requested operations
    Decision -> deterministic governance result
    Receipt  -> durable evidence of acceptance or rejection

They are frozen so later code cannot quietly rewrite a proposal or receipt after
it has crossed a boundary. Freezing is not a security sandbox; callers can still
place mutable JSON containers inside a value. The durable protection comes from
canonical serialization inside one SQLite transaction. The dataclasses provide
legibility and discourage accidental mutation before that point.

JSON is the interchange substrate because proposals and state must survive
process, language, and provider replacement. Do not add arbitrary Python
objects, datetime instances, callbacks, database handles, or provider SDK types
to these contracts. If a value cannot be serialized and replayed deterministically,
it does not belong in authoritative state.

Operation is deliberately generic at the transport layer while its action names
remain governed. Adding a Literal here does not authorize the action. Governance
must validate it and replay must define its exact state transition. Those three
owners must move together or the record could accept behavior it cannot rebuild.
