"""
WAKE STORAGE CONTRACT
=======================

This module defines the persistence boundary consumed by the kernel. The
contract describes semantic transactions, verified replay, durable append, and
proposal identity without naming SQLite, SQL, files, branches, or any future
database technology.

SQLite is the first implementation because it is simple and local. It is not
the product contract. A PostgreSQL or other durable backend should be able to
replace it by implementing these interfaces while preserving event semantics.

Hashing also lives here because event identity must remain backend-independent.
A storage implementation may choose different physical tables or transaction
primitives, but it must not silently invent a different semantic event chain.
