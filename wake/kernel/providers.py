"""
REPLACEABLE INTELLIGENCE BOUNDARY
=================================

Providers receive bounded Context and return untrusted Proposal. They never
receive a database connection, governance object, transition callback, or other
capability that can mutate authoritative state.

The Protocol is intentionally tiny so real model vendors and deterministic test
providers cross the same boundary. Provider substitution should alter proposal
quality or metadata, not persistence, governance, replay, or receipts.

The fake implementations are product evidence, not toys. They remove model
behavior as a variable while proving that continuity comes from the record. A
fresh fake instance can continue work because Context contains the durable
facts; no instance retains a conversation or private scratch state.
