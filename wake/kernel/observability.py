"""
GENERIC APPLICATION OBSERVABILITY
=================================

This module projects already-durable wake evidence into a bounded,
application-oriented view suitable for diagnostics and presentation.

It does not add telemetry events, mutate the record, register applications, or
create a second source of truth. A deployment may discard and regenerate the
result at any time from its authoritative Record.

The implementation deliberately understands only generic wake contracts:
application envelopes, governed apply_application operations, and
application-scoped invocation lifecycle evidence. Domain meaning remains owned
by the application.
