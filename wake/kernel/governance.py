WAKE GOVERNANCE
=================

This module is the mechanical authority between untrusted proposals and durable
state. Intelligence may suggest a transition. Only these deterministic rules
decide whether the transition is permitted.

The separation is the kernel's central trust boundary:

    provider output  = untrusted proposal
    governance       = deterministic permission
    replay           = accepted state transition
    record           = durable evidence

Governance never calls a model, interprets persuasive prose, or changes policy
based on the provider that submitted a proposal. Given the same state, revision,
and proposal, it must return the same decision.

Evaluation is whole-proposal atomic. If any operation is stale, malformed,
duplicated, or invalid for the current lifecycle, the complete proposal is
rejected. We do not partially accept the safe-looking operations because doing
so would create state the proposer never observed or intended as a standalone
transition.

Rejection is expected product behavior, not exceptional corruption. A rejected
proposal becomes a hash-linked receipt while authoritative state and revision
remain unchanged. This lets failure teach future disposable invocations without
letting failure become accepted state.

Rules in this module validate whether a change may happen. They must not mutate
state. Record replay owns how an accepted action changes state. Whenever an
action is added, its models, governance, replay, proof, and presentation must be
updated together.
