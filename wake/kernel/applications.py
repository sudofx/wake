"""
WAKE APPLICATION CONTRACT
===========================

Applications add domain meaning above the kernel without becoming a second
authority. This module defines the smallest application-facing boundary needed
to register deterministic domain transitions while keeping SQLite, governance,
and replay owned by wake.

An application never receives a Record or database connection through this
contract. It declares identity, version, deterministic actions, and requested
external-effect capabilities. ApplicationHost turns an intent into one generic
apply_application operation; Kernel governance independently recomputes the
declared transition before the event may be accepted.

Accepted events store the verified resulting JSON state. Replay therefore does
not need installed application code and historical generic record integrity does
not depend on a plugin loader or a specific application still being present.
