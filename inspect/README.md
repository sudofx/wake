# Inspect WAKE independently

WAKE is infrastructure for preserving accountable work when the model, process or
person doing that work changes. Its kernel stores a durable record, evaluates
proposed changes under application rules, and returns a receipt. Research is its
current operational application; a small task-list application demonstrates the
same kernel without research concepts, a model or a network.

The central claim to examine is narrow: accepted work has recorded consequences,
rejected proposals remain inspectable, and replay can recover the recorded state.
An accepted proposal is not established scientific truth. A receipt for a rejected
proposal is not an accepted transition. Corrections preserve earlier history.

An application defines meaning and acceptance rules. A runtime selects the record,
installed code, credentials and execution permissions. A model may propose work;
it receives no arbitrary database or filesystem authority. Each research node
owns one operational database. The public website is a derived snapshot and
cannot establish current operational state or change governance.

Start with [architecture](architecture.md), then examine [demo.json](demo.json)
and its [evidence and reproduction procedure](evidence.md). The demonstration
records accepted → rejected → accepted decisions, with revisions 1 → 1 → 2.
The rejection reports “task does not exist”; replay checks the record chain and
reconstructed state. Inspect the actual artifact for identifiers and hashes.

Read [limitations](limitations.md) before drawing broader conclusions. Use the
[independent evaluation questions](evaluate.md) to challenge the design and record
missing evidence. [manifest.json](manifest.json) identifies this inspection bundle;
compare its actual fields with the files rather than assuming a certification.

This static inspection material requires no account or JavaScript. Reading it has
no governance effect. It neither assumes personal identity nor makes a claim about
consciousness, quantum physics or scientific discovery.
