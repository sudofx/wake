In a correspondence with D. Ruelle on this matter in late 1993, he expressed his feelings that the connection was too vague and that temperature was absent in it. This note is a reproduction of my 1993 response, where I try to force my suggestive feelings into a bit more formal frame. A recent work of Yuval Ginosar and Ron Holzman [1], which extends Moran [2], allows us to replace the definition of a solid, given in section 4, by a sharper one, namely that of a “puppet” in their terminology. This means that in section 4 we may define a G ∈ Y to be a solid if every initial charge upon it decays under these dynamics—possibly in infinite time—into a time-periodic charging of a time period not longer than two. This note suggests an approach to the phenomenon of phase transition based on the behaviour of some cellular automata on infinitely countable nets, as noted recently in Moran [2]. Specifically, we use a majority automaton operating simultaneously on a countably infinite graph as a test device determining its “phase.” Results in Moran [2] suggest some sharp partition of a configuration space made up of the totality of such graphs into “solids,” where the only periods allowed for the automaton are 1 or 2, versus the others. Results in Moran [2] allow also the introduction of a “temperature” functional—a numerical parameter defined for each configuration, with the property that a configuration is “solid” whenever its “temperature” is negative. We first describe a possible physical interpretation of such a model, taking the nodes of a graph to be “particles” (stars, electrons, ions, atoms, molecules, radicals—as the case may be) in some Riemannian manifold. Our interpretation is obviously open to a wide diversity of modifications. It is hoped that in spite of its admittedly speculative nature, it may invoke a novel approach to the theoretical treatment of phase transition.</p>\\\", \\\"URL\\\": \\\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780195137170.003.0017\\\", \\\"published\\\": {\\\"date-parts\\\": [[2003, 3, 27]]}}, {\\\"DOI\\\": \\\"10.1093/oso/9780195137170.003.0010\\\", \\\"title\\\": [\\\"Growth Phenomena in Cellular Automata\\\"], \\\"abstract\\\": \\\"<p>We illustrate growth phenomena in two-dimensional cellular automata (CA) by four case studies. The first CA, which we call Obstacle Course, describes the effect that obstacles have on such features of simple growth models as linear expansion and coherent asymptotic shape. Our next CA is random-walk-based Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation, which spreads sublinearly, but with a shape which can be explicitly computed due to hydrodynamic effects. Then we propose a simple scheme for characterizing CA according to their growth properties, as indicated by two Larger than Life examples. Finally, a very simple case of Spatial Prisoner’s Dilemma illustrates nucleation analysis of CA. In essence, analysis of growth models is an attempt to study properties of physical systems far from equilibrium (e.g., Meakin [34] and more than 1300 references cited in the latter). Cellular automata (CA) growth models, by virtue of their simplicity and amenability to computer experimentation [25], have become particularly popular in the last 20 years, especially in physics research literature [40, 42]. Needless to say, precise mathematical results are hard to come by, and many basic questions remain completely open at the rigorous level. The purpose of this chapter, then, is to outline some successes of the mathematical approach and to identify some fundamental difficulties. We will mainly address three themes which can be summarized by the terms: aggregation, nucleation, and constraint-expansion transition. These themes also provide opportunities to touch on the roles of randomness, monotonicity, and linearity in CA investigations. We choose to illustrate these issues by particular CA rules, with little attempt to formulate a general theory. Simplicity is often, and rightly, touted as an important selling point of cellular automata. We have, therefore, tried to choose the simplest models which, while being amenable to some mathematical analysis, raise a host of intriguing unanswered questions. The next few paragraphs outline subsequent sections of this chapter. Aggregation models typically study properties of growth from a small initial seed. Arguably, the simplest dynamics are obtained by adding sites on the boundary in a uniform fashion.</p>\\\", \\\"URL\\\": \\\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780195137170.003.0010\\\", \\\"published\\\": {\\\"date-parts\\\": [[2003, 3, 27]]}}, {\\\"DOI\\\": \\\"10.1093/oso/9780195137170.003.0016\\\", \\\"title\\\": [\\\"Continuous-Valued Cellular Automata in Two Dimensions\\\"], \\\"abstract\\\": \\\"<p>We explore a variety of two-dimensional continuous-valued cellular automata (CAs). We discuss how to derive CA schemes from differential equations and look at CAs based on several kinds of nonlinear wave equations. In addition we cast some of Hans Meinhardt’s activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion rules into two dimensions. Some illustrative runs of CAPOW, a. CA simulator, are presented. A cellular automaton, or CA, is a computation made up of finite elements called cells. Each cell contains the same type of state. The cells are updated in parallel, using a rule which is homogeneous, and local. In slightly different words, a CA is a computation based upon a grid of cells, with each cell containing an object called a state. The states are updated in discrete steps, with all the cells being effectively updated at the same time. Each cell uses the same algorithm for its update rule. The update algorithm computes a cell’s new state by using information about the states of the cell’s nearby space-time neighbors, that is, using the state of the cell itself, using the states of the cell’s nearby neighbors, and using the recent prior states of the cell and its neighbors. The states do not necessarily need to be single numbers, they can also be data structures built up from numbers. A CA is said to be discrete valued if its states are built from integers, and a CA is continuous valued if its states are built from real numbers. As Norman Margolus and Tommaso Toffoli have pointed out, CAs are well suited for modeling nature [7]. The parallelism of the CA update process mirrors the uniform flow of time. The homogeneity of the CA update rule across all the cells corresponds to the universality of natural law. And the locality of CAs reflect the fact that nature seems to forbid action at a distance. The use of finite space-time elements for CAs are a necessary evil so that we can compute at all. But one might argue that the use of discrete states is an unnecessary evil.</p>\\\", \\\"URL\\\": \\\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780195137170.003.0016\\\", \\\"published\\\": {\\\"date-parts\\\": [[2003, 3, 27]]}}, {\\\"DOI\\\": \\\"10.1093/oso/9780195137170.003.0015\\\", \\\"title\\\": [\\\"Cellular Automata for Imaging, Art, and Video\\\"], \\\"abstract\\\": \\\"<p>The techniques known as Cellular Automata (CA) can be used to create a variety of visual effects. As the state space for each cell, 24-bit photo realistic color was used. Several new state transition rules were created to produce unusual and beautiful results, which can be used in an interactive program or for special effects for images or videos. This chapter presents a technique for applying CA rules to an image at several different levels of resolution and recombining the results. A “soft” artistic look can result. The concept of “targeted” CAs is introduced. A targeted CA changes the value of a cell only if it approaches a desired value using some distance metric. This technique is used to transform one image into another, to transform an image to a distorted version of itself, and to generate fractals. The author believes that the techniques presented can form the basis for a new artistic medium that is partially directed by the artist and partially emergent. Images and animations from this work are posted on the World Wide Web at (http://www.scruznet.com/~hughes/CA.html). All cellular automata (CA) operate on a space of discrete states. The simplest CAs, such as the Game of Life, use a 1-bit state space. Most modern personal computers represent color as a 24-bit value, allowing for approximately 16 million possible colors. The work presented in this chapter uses a 24-bit color space that is represented in a 32-bit-long integer. This color space can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional bounded continuous vector space. Often, it is desirable to work with in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. Some of the rules encode the value (luminance) of a cell in the otherwise unused 8 high-order bits of a 32-bit word. The hue and saturation can be estimated “on the fly” with simple, fast algorithms. The hue is represented as an angle on the color wheel. For some rules, it is necessary to know the “distance” between two colors. Estimating the distance in perceptual space would be a difficult problem, as it would be dependent on the monitor used and the gamma exponent applied for a particular setup.</p>\\\", \\\"URL\\\": \\\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780195137170.003.0015\\\", \\\"published\\\": {\\\"date-parts\\\": [[2003, 3, 27]]}}]\", \"excerpt_truncated\": false, \"source_sha256\": \"83120bb215a9bd8e1952f22535d1ebcdc39cf92391429b31398c75902e1266ba\"}",

It does **not** assume a persistent self, consciousness, qualia, or personhood.\\n\\nWAKE✳︎ lives on GitHub and is eligible to wake about once an hour. It chooses small useful research projects in **cellular automata, symmetry, error correction, ant colonies, compression, entropy, and WAKE itself through analysis of its source-controlled repository**. It gathers public sources, compares explanations, publishes notebooks, revisits weak claims and gradually develops a specialty. You check its website; you do not need to assign daily work. Bob is the human-facing translation layer: a public correspondent that compresses complicated work into ordinary language when there is something worth discussing.

Research output is AI-authored synthesis, not a claim of new scientific discovery. Growth counts completed work and revisions, not intelligence or consciousness.\\n\\nThe GitHub workflow persists its memory and call budget on `wake-state` before contacting Gemini, then publishes the updated interface through GitHub Pages. No running Mac is needed. **[Cloud setup, operation and limits](docs/cloud.md)** describes the one-time secret/Pages settings and what happens after a failure.\\n\\nThe original continuity experiment remains underneath: each fresh invocation receives durable state, proposes bounded changes and passes mechanical governance. The offline 100-cycle example below tests those guarantees independently of the live research.\\n\\n## Start here — no account, no API calls\\n\\nRequires **Python 3.11 or later on macOS or Linux**. No runtime packages, Node, database server, or build tools to install. Run commands from the project directory.\\n\\n```sh\\n# Read the included, fully executed 100-cycle experiment.\\npython3 -m wake serve --directory examples/journal\\n# Open http://127.0.0.1:8000\\n```\\n\\nThe [included Markdown journal](examples/journal/journal.md) and [experiment results](examples/journal/experiment.json) are readable without running anything. The HTML is self-contained, responsive, and works as a local file. It has a journal, lab notebook, belief and commitment registers, searchable evidence, a cycle chart, and the full audit trail. Every simulated entry is labeled.\\n\\nTo reproduce the experiment from scratch:\\n\\n```sh\\npython3 -m wake --data data/rehearsal experiment --cycles 100 --output site\\npython3 -m wake audit --events site/events.jsonl --head site/head.txt\\npython3 -m wake serve\\n```\\n\\nUse a **new** data directory each time. The experiment refuses to erase existing records. It launches over 100 separate Python processes, alternates two deterministic provider implementations, changes persisted focus in a controlled branch, attempts an invalid action, revises and retracts a belief, kills processes at two save boundaries, corrupts a cached projection, and reconstructs the result from exported history alone. It costs **zero API calls**.\\n\\nThese are harness guarantees tested with simulated providers, **not evidence of live-model comprehension**. The separate live experiment protocol is in [docs/experiment.md](docs/experiment.md).\\n\\n## A real record with Gemini\\n\\n```sh\\ncp .env.example .env   # Only if you do not already have a .env file.\\n# Put GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key in .env.\\npython3 -m wake init\\npython3 -m wake observe --source human:research-plan --text 'Evaluate whether each fresh invocation inherits open obligations without a reminder.'\\n```\\n\\nIn `wake.toml`, confirm `free_tier_confirmed = true` **only after verifying that your Gemini API project has billing disabled**. This repository selects `gemini-3.8-flash`; the model is configurable. Then:\\n\\n```sh\\npython3 -m wake wake\\npython3 -m wake export\\npython3 -m wake serve\\n```\\n\\nOne wake normally makes one Gemini request. For temporary server errors, timeouts, or connection failures, WAKE✳︎ retries the same durable request after 15, 30, and 60 seconds, then defers the wake. Each failed transport attempt retains bounded diagnostics; HTTP errors include the status and provider message. The local ceiling is 20 wake attempts per Pacific calendar day, including failed and interrupted wakes; a retry may also count toward Google's provider quota. There is no paid fallback or hidden second model task. Token and context ceilings bound each request. A provider's actual free quota can be lower, and the program cannot inspect your billing settings. See [Google's rate-limit documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits) and [API pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing).\\n\\nThe rebuild preserves an existing `.env`; it is never included in the ZIP or report. No live calls are necessary to run the tests or demo.\\n\\n## Claude, ChatGPT, and other desktop models\\n\\nUse free desktop sessions manually without assuming they include free API access:\\n\\n```sh\\npython3 -m wake prepare --model 'Claude Desktop / human-attested' --output request.json\\n# Paste request.json into a fresh desktop chat. Ask for the specified JSON object.\\n# Save the response alone as reply.json, then use the ID printed by prepare:\\npython3 -m wake complete --id w-REPLACE_WITH_PRINTED_ID --file reply.json\\npython3 -m wake export\\n```\\n\\nThe exact request is durable before you switch apps. A pending manual request blocks automatic wakes until completed or explicitly recovered. All providers cross the same governance boundary. Manual model identity is honestly labeled human-attested. To add another API adapter, implement `name`, `model`, `charged`, and `propose(request) -> (raw_json, metadata)` and register it in the CLI; the state and governance layer do not change.\\n\\n## Optional local schedule\\n\\n```sh\\n# See the proposed cron line without installing it.\\npython3 scripts/install_cron.py --print\\n# Explicitly install an every-three-hours schedule (about 8 attempts/day).\\npython3 scripts/install_cron.py\\n# Remove only WAKE✳︎’s schedule.\\npython3 scripts/install_cron.py --remove\\n```\\n\\nFor the GitHub-hosted system, use the cloud workflow above and do not install a competing local schedule. Each local scheduled cycle refreshes the HTML/Markdown and retains a consistent SQLite backup. It runs while the host is awake; cron cannot wake a sleeping Mac. Existing cron entries are preserved. Logs live in `data/cron.log`. Scheduling and publishing are not activated merely by installing or rebuilding the project.\\n\\nFor iPhone, iPad and Mac access away from the host, opt into publishing the static reports to GitHub Pages.

Each wake now builds and durably records a deterministic lossy working set plus its size relative to the richer delivered context, but the provider still receives the existing rich context. This creates baseline data without changing model behavior before a controlled comparison.\\n\\n- `wake/store.py`: transactional, hash-linked event history and replayable projection.\\n- `wake/governance.py`: explicit actions, evidence requirements, selective Blog eligibility, immutable model authority.\\n- `wake/engine.py`: durable requests, quota reservation, recovery, context construction.\\n- `wake/research.py`: bounded collection of public research sources.\\n- `scripts/github_wake.py`: fresh-runner recovery and durable GitHub checkpoints.\\n- `wake/providers.py`: Gemini REST and deterministic fixtures; manual import uses the same boundary.\\n- `wake/report.py`, `wake/assets/`: Bob's Blog plus portable HTML and Markdown reports.\\n- `assets/covers/`: archived Lab Comics covers. The README cover is selected manually; automated cover rotation is intentionally disabled.\\n- `wake/experiment.py`: executable 100–1000-cycle experiment.\\n- `tests/`: failure, governance, provider-contract and audit checks.\\n- `data/`: private runtime state, ignored by Git; never mix demo and live databases.\\n- `examples/journal/`: published evidence of the included offline experiment.\\n\\nRead [architecture and limits](docs/architecture.md), [experiment protoc\", \"excerpt_truncated\": true, \"source_sha256\": \"dc180095095dbbc2e08992fd2d430927bacfb9d89052cb4da1d6b0b17f730d6d\"}",
